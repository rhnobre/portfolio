As an experienced data scientist and academic researcher, I combine analytical skills, the ability to work in team environments and attention to detail. Having spent the last few years applying Machine Learning to real problems in the Brazilian government, I developed critical thinking and problem solving skills.

My credentials include a PhD in Teleinformatics Engineering and a Masters in Computer Science, in addition to being actively participating in scientific research projects at UECE and UFC, focusing on the areas of NLP and Image Processing.

I am the author of books, book chapters and articles published in international journals, as well as reviewing international journals such as IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Electronics Letters and, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

**Background in:** Python, NLP, Machine Learning and, Mathematical Optimisation.
