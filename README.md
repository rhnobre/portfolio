As an experienced data scientist and academic researcher, I combine analytical skills, the ability to work in teams and attention to detail. Having spent the last few years applying Machine Learning to real problems of the Brazilian government.

I am currently a Data Scientist at the Federal Data Processing Service ([SERPRO](https://serpro.gov.br/)), coordinator of undergraduate courses in Systems Analysis and Development at Faculdade CDL and professor of undergraduate and graduate courses in specialization / MBA in Data Sciences ([UNI7](https://www.uni7.edu.br/)), Software Engineering ([FIC](https://estacio.br/)), Network Architecture and Cloud Computing, BI - Information Management and Business Intelligence ([BSB](https://bsbr.com.br/)), etc.

My credentials include the Ph.D. in Teleinformatics Engineering and, the MSc in Computer Science, in addition to actively participating in scientific research projects at [UECE](http://www.uece.br/) and [UFC](http://www.ufc.br/), focusing on the areas of NLP and Image Processing.

I am the author of books, book chapters and articles published in international journals, as well as a reviewer of international journals such as IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Electronics Letters and IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

**Background in:** Python, NLP, Machine Learning and, Mathematical Optimisation.

## Soluctions:

Among the solutions focused on AI in which I participated, I mention the Legislative Observatory. This system uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to select new legislative proposals from the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate that have a fiscal impact on public spending in Brazil ([Legislative Observatory](https://www.serpro.gov.br/menu/noticias/noticias-2020/inteligencia-tesouro-proposicoes-gastos-publicos)).
